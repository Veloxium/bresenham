# Bresenham Web Calculation Algorithm
This project implements a simple Bresenham web calculation algorithm in JavaScript. The algorithm calculates values of `p`, `x`, and `y` based on given parameters.

## Introduction
The Bresenham line drawing algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a raster display. It determines which points on a Cartesian plane should be plotted to form a straight line between two given points.
This project provides a simple implementation of the Bresenham algorithm and calculates values of `p`, `x`, and `y` for each step along the line.

with the following conditions :
  - `x1`: x-coordinate of the starting point
  - `y1`: y-coordinate of the starting point
  - `x2`: x-coordinate of the ending point
  - `y2`: y-coordinate of the ending point
