# Bresenham Web Calculation Algorithm with Line Chart

This project implements a simple Bresenham web calculation algorithm in JavaScript. The algorithm calculates values of `p`, `x`, and `y` based on given parameters.

## Introduction

The Bresenham line drawing algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a raster display. It determines which points on a Cartesian plane should be plotted to form a straight line between two given points.

This project provides a simple implementation of the Bresenham algorithm and calculates values of `p`, `x`, and `y` for each step along the line.

### New Feature: Line Chart

The latest feature added to this project is a line chart that visualizes the calculated values of `p`, `x`, and `y` as the line is drawn. This enhances the understanding of how the Bresenham algorithm works by providing a graphical representation of its calculations.

with the following required parameters:

- `x1`: x-coordinate of the starting point
- `y1`: y-coordinate of the starting point
- `x2`: x-coordinate of the ending point
- `y2`: y-coordinate of the ending point

The function returns an array of objects, thats represents a point on the line with properties `p`, `x`, and `y`.
